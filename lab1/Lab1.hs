power1 n k | k < 0 = error "power1: negative argument"
power1 n k = product (replicate (fromInteger k) n)

power2 :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
power2 n k | k < 0 = error "power2: negative argument"
power2 n 0 = 1

--4:
--Test motivation: 0 is a base case and should work, -1 generates error (not with prop_powers though), 1 is lowest that is not a base case and should be tested
--5 is odd number, 10 is even number, 51 is pretty high and 10000 is very high. Power should work for all these (higher than 10000 is very slow)
--if we have a comprehension list like this we get all types of combinations between these values
testlist = [(x,y) | x<-[0,-1,1,5,10,51,10000], y<-[0,-1,1,5,10,51,10000]]

--run test by writing "mytest testlist" in terminal
mytest :: [(Integer, Integer)] -> Bool
mytest []          = True

prop_powers :: Integer -> Integer -> Bool
prop_powers n k | k < 0 = True --QuickCheck can't handle the error "power: negative argument"
prop_powers n k = power n k == power1 n k && power1 n k == power2 n k
